Case Study of Customer Churn Prediction Model
Creating churn prediction models involves using historical customer data to predict the likelihood of the current customer leaving or continuing with a particular service/product. The data used for the predictive models include product usage data and direct customer feedback. Besides, the predictive models identify the different trends and patterns in the data to forecast customer churn.

Consider an e-commerce company with historical data on how their clients have interacted with their services. The company wants to know the likelihood of customers churning so they can launch targeted marketing campaigns.
